            <p className="text-body text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              RISE was founded on the belief that true academic growth comes from patient guidance, 
              not pressure. We view education as a long-term journey where each student deserves 
              personalized attention and the freedom to learn at their own pace. Our approach 
              emphasizes building strong foundations first, then gradually developing advanced 
              understanding through consistent practice and mentorship.

            <h3 className="text-subsection mb-6">The RISE Difference</h3>
            <p className="text-body text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              What sets us apart is our commitment to being more than just a coaching center. 
              We function as an academic ecosystem where mentors take genuine responsibility 
              for each student's progress. Parents receive regular, honest updates, and students 
              benefit from a structured environment that encourages questions, addresses challenges 
              early, and celebrates incremental improvements.

            <h3 className="text-subsection mb-6">Consistency Over Quick Results</h3>
            <p className="text-body text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              We prioritize sustainable academic development over short-term gains. Our methodology 
              focuses on creating disciplined study habits, strengthening conceptual understanding, 
              and building the confidence needed for independent learning. This consistent approach 
              ensures that students not only perform well academically but also develop the 
              skills and mindset required for future success.

            <h3 className="text-subsection mb-6">Our Commitment</h3>
            <p className="text-body text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              At RISE, we measure our success by the growth and confidence of our students. 
              We remain committed to maintaining small group sizes, providing individual attention, 
              and fostering an environment where learning is both challenging and enjoyable. 
              Our goal is to partner with parents in nurturing students who are not just 
              academically proficient, but also curious, disciplined, and self-motivated.
