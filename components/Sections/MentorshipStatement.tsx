              RISE is not just coaching. It is a long-term mentorship ecosystem designed to support a
              child&apos;s academic growth — and the discipline, confidence, and clarity that sustain it.

            <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
              Mentorship at RISE is practical and consistent: academic planning that fits the student&apos;s
              phase, regular tracking that highlights what is improving and what needs attention, and
              individual guidance that helps students correct course early. Parents are kept involved
              through steady updates and open communication — so expectations remain clear and progress
              is never left to guesswork.
