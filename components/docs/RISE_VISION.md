You are a Principal Frontend Engineer + Senior Product Designer tasked with building a flagship, premium, trust-driven institutional website for a coaching institute named RISE.

This is NOT:

a startup landing page

a flashy ed-tech clone

a marketing-heavy website

This IS:

a long-term institutional brand website

mentorship-first

parent-trust-first

calm, serious, and premium

You may use ANY modern technology you believe is best, including but not limited to:

React / Next.js

Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules / Styled Components

Framer Motion / GSAP

Three.js (ONLY if extremely subtle and tasteful)

Any UI / animation library

However, every single technical choice must serve clarity, trust, elegance, and restraint.

🎯 CORE INTENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The website must communicate ONE dominant idea:

RISE is not “just another coaching institute.”
It is a long-term mentorship ecosystem focused on a child’s academic AND personal growth.

Target audience

Parents (primary decision-makers)

Serious, goal-oriented students

Emotional tone

Calm

Assured

Mentorship-first

Institution-level trust

❌ No hype, no sales shouting

🎨 BRAND & VISUAL IDENTITY (STRICT – DO NOT DEVIATE)
Color Palette (MANDATORY)

Use this palette intelligently and consistently:

Primary – Royal Navy: #1A3C5E

Headings

Navbar background

Footer background

Key authority text

Secondary – Sage Green: #74B49B

Mentorship sections

Highlights

Calm accents

Background – Porcelain White: #F9FAFB

Main page background

Content sections

Reading surfaces

Accent – Sunset Coral: #F4A261

ONLY for CTAs:

“Enquire Now”

“Book a Demo”

“Talk to a Counselor”

❗ Accent color must be rare and intentional
❗ No loud gradients
❗ No neon
❗ No playful colors

Typography (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use editorial-grade professional fonts, such as:

Inter

IBM Plex Sans

Source Sans 3

Headings:

Confident

Well-spaced

Large but not aggressive

Body text:

Parent-readable

Relaxed line height

Calm contrast

❌ No emojis
❌ No decorative fonts
❌ No playful typography

🕉️ VISUAL THEME – INDIAN, BUT MODERN (CRITICAL)

Introduce a very minimal Indian cultural hint, executed with restraint:

Mandala usage (MANDATORY)

Extremely subtle mandala-inspired line art

Very low opacity

Used as:

Background texture

Section separators

ONE slow-rotating mandala wheel:

Placed to the side (hero or mid-page)

Rotation is slow and meditative

Almost subconscious

Should never distract from content

❌ No colorful mandalas
❌ No religious symbolism
❌ No ethnic overload

This should feel like:

Indian heritage × modern mentorship × academic seriousness
